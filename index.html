                <h3>How long does it take to build a website?</h3>
                <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The time it takes to build a website really depends on what you want your site to do.<br> For most basic or standard websites, the full process usually takes around 1–3 weeks. This includes planning the layout, designing the pages, adding your content, and making sure everything looks good on both mobile and desktop.

If your project includes more advanced features, like an online store, custom dashboards, booking systems, or integrations, the timeline may extend to 4–6 weeks, sometimes a bit longer depending on the level of complexity. These types of features require extra development, testing, and fine-tuning to ensure everything works perfectly.

Once you share your requirements, we'll give you a clear timeline so you know exactly what to expect. We also keep you updated throughout the entire process, from the first design draft to the moment your website goes live. Our goal is to make the experience smooth, transparent, and stress-free for you.</p>

                <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, we do. After your website goes live, we offer ongoing maintenance to keep everything running smoothly. This includes updating your content, fixing any issues, improving performance, keeping plugins and security features up to date, and making adjustments as your business grows.<br>

You can choose between regular monthly maintenance or on-demand support, depending on what works best for you. Our goal is to ensure your website stays secure, fast, and updated at all times, so you can focus on your business while we handle the technical details.</p>

                <p>Our pricing is flexible and depends on what you need for your website. We offer different packages so you can choose what fits your budget and goals. Smaller projects, like simple portfolio or business websites, usually fall within our basic pricing, while more advanced websites with custom features, online stores, or integrations follow our standard or premium pricing.

Before we begin, we discuss your requirements in detail and provide a transparent quote with no hidden charges. This includes the cost of design, development, optional maintenance, and any additional features you may want. Our goal is to give you a pricing structure that is fair, easy to understand, and tailored to your exact needs.</p>
